\par In this section we begin to search for candidate events to perform the cross section analysis. This search is broken into three stages.  In the first stage, we preselect a set of charged current inclusive interactions. The role of this ``CC Inclusive" filter is largely to reduce the cosmic background and to select neutrino interactions in time with the beam spill that contain a forward-going $\mu$ candidate.  When we've filted events with no candidate track that meets all CC Inclusive criteria, we run shower reconstruction on the remaining events.  This involves first identifying electromagnetic-like candidate hit activity, clustering these candidate hits together with open-source computer vision tools, matching clusters across planes and reconstructing the clusters into shower candidates.  Finally, we consider two parallel $\pi^0$ candidate selections: those that require two reconstructed showers in the interaction, and those that require one.  We perform our final cross section analysis on both samples.

%\par Throughout the next few sections, we will show data-MC comparisons at each stage of the selection chain.  These comparisons

\subsection{Signal and Backgrounds Descriptions}
\par We begin our discussion of the CC Inclusive filter with a set of signal and background definitions.  These categories are used to tune analysis cuts and to present resulting pass rates and sample composition after each filter is applied.  These categories are: Signal, $\nu_\mu$ CC-0$\pi^0$, $\nu_\mu$ NC-0$\pi^0$, $\nu_\mu$ NC-$\pi^0$, Other, Cosmic + Neutrino, and Cosmic. Backgrounds will be further broken down into subcategories in data-MC comparison histograms to give the reader a more in-depth look at the selected interactions.  These categories (and subcategories) are described here. Note that all signal and background categories--except data-extracted ``Cosmic"--are defined by the GENIE simulation final state information stored for each interaction.

%We do this for the first part of the analysis (CC Inclusive Selection) by using truth information to track the origin of the candidate $\mu$. We will revisit the background breakdown once we've reconstructed showers and have this additional truth information.

\paragraph{Signal - $\nu_\mu$ CC 1$\pi^0$} The Signal category describes events with a single $\mu^-$, single final state $\pi^0$, any additional particles (except a second final state $\pi^0$), and a fiducial volume-contained true-interaction vertex. The fiducial volume (FV) is (20,20,10) cm from the TPC boundaries in (x,y,z). Note that this is the only category with a FV requirement.

\paragraph{ $\nu_\mu$ CC 0$\pi^0$}
The CC 0$\pi^0$ background describes charged current interactions with a single $\mu^-$, and 0 observable $\pi^0$'s originating from the interaction vertex.  Sub-categories of this background include CC $\pi^{\pm}$ charge exchange (`CC Cex'), interactions with 1 or more photons in the final state (`X$\rightarrow$ $\geq$ 1$\gamma$'), and other charged current (`CC Other') interactions. CC 0$\pi^0$ is the dominant background at the CC Inclusive Selection stage as we haven't yet reconstructed and selected for events with $\pi^0$'s.

\paragraph{  $\nu_\mu$ NC 0$\pi^0$}
The NC 0$\pi^0$ background describes neutral current events with no observable $\pi^0$ originating from the vertex.  
%NC 0$\pi^0$ will be shown in lime green in CC Inclusive Selection data-MC stacked histograms. 

%electromagnetic activity at the vertex, charge exchange, $K^\pm$ decay, $\eta$ decay, proton and neutron inelastic events. 

\paragraph{  $\nu_\mu$ NC $\pi^0$}
The NC $\pi^0$ background includes neutral current events in which 1 or more $\pi^0$'s originate at the neutrino vertex.  
%This background will be shown in dark green in data-MC stacked histograms.

%This is the dominant background at the final stage of the analysis.

\paragraph{ Other}
This category includes CC 1$\pi^0$ events with true vertex outside the fiducial volume, CC events with multiple $\pi^0$'s originating from the vertex, $\overline{\nu}_\mu$ and $\nu_e$-induced interactions. 
%These backgrounds will be shown in shades of purple and yellow in data-MC stacked histograms.

\paragraph{ Cosmic + Neutrino }
In this class of events, we have a neutrino interacting somewhere in the cryostat during the beam spill, but we have instead selected a cosmic ray as our candidate $\mu$. 
%This background is shown in dark grey in data-MC stacked histograms.  

\paragraph{Cosmic }
Data cosmics are selected and scaled from External BNB (``EXTBNB" or ``OffBeam") data.  This background describes events in which a cosmic interacts in the detector during the beam spill window when there is no neutrino interaction anywhere in the TPC.  This background will be shown in light grey in all data-MC stacked histograms.


%\subsection{Sample Normalization}
%In order to compare MC and data after various cut stages, we must normalize the POT of the MC and OffBeam samples to the OnBeam sample. Starting sample POT's are summarized in Table \ref{tab:pot}.  We calculate these POT's and other scaling factors for On and OffBeam with a script provided by Zarko \cite{bib:zarkopot}; these factors are summarized in Table \ref{tab:ext_1D}. The scalings are described below, and will be updated using full Run1 data and MC when available.\\
%
%\noindent \textbf{ONBEAM POT} 
%
%\noindent \textbf{Anatree:} 
%%\begin{equation}
%%  POT_{ON} = \frac{N_{ON}}{N^{4.95E19}_{ON}} * 0.495 
%%\end{equation}
%
%%\noindent where $N_{ON}$ is the number of OnBeam events in the utilized sample (540817) and $N^{4.95E19}_{ON}$ is the number of OnBeam events equivalent to $4.95E19$ (567157).
%The Anatree OnBeam POT is calculated using the OnBeam file list passed to the anatree-version of SelectionII. This list can be found here: 
%\par /uboone/app/users/ahack/MCC8\_3/OnBeam.txt 
%
%\noindent The Anatree OnBeam POT is found to be 0.487e20.
%
%\noindent \textbf{Reco2:} The Reco2 OnBeam POT is calculated using the json file output from grid processing. The OnBeam POT is found to be 0.492e20.
%
%\noindent \textbf{OFF to ONBEAM POT} 
%
%\noindent \textbf{Anatree}: \\
%To scale the OffBeam sample to OnBeam, we divide the number of triggers in our OnBeam sample (10917359) by the number of triggers in our OffBeam sample (8926439). The resulting scale factor to go from Off to OnBeam is 1.2230.
%
%The OffBeam file list can be found here: 
%\par /uboone/app/users/ahack/MCC8\_3/OffBeam.txt 

%\noindent \textbf{Reco2:}\\
%To scale the OffBeam sample to OnBeam, we divide the number of triggers in our OnBeam sample (10993739) by the number of triggers in our OffBeam sample (5069967). The resulting scale factor for Reco2 files is 2.1684.
%
%\noindent \textbf{MC to ONBEAM POT} 
%\noindent \textbf{Anatree:} 
%\noindent POT is currently not stored in anatree.  Thus, to calculate MC POT for the anatree portion of the analysis, we use the scaling factor derived externally \cite{bib:normdatamc} :
%%\begin{equation}
%\begin{align}
%  POT_{MC} &= \frac{N_{MC}}{99035.2} \\
%  &= 3.389e20
% \end{align}
%%\end{equation}
%
%where $N_{MC}$ is the number of events in the original sample before any cuts are performed. Note that the anatree stage is only used for cut tuning, not for extracting final efficiencies, purities or event rates.  Thus, this method is sufficient for our needs.
%
%\noindent \textbf{Reco2:}
%For the Reco2 portion of the analysis, the MC POT is calculated by summing over the POT in all utilized subruns.  The MC POT is 4.232e20.
%
%\noindent  In both files types, the scaling factor for MC to OnBeam is given by:
%\begin{equation}
%  f_{MC} = \frac{POT_{ON}}{POT_{MC}} 
%\end{equation}

\subsection{Tuning CC Inclusive Selection}
In this section we describe analysis cuts employed in the CC Inclusive Selection stage of this analysis. The reconstructed products we utilize here are the neutrino-candidate pandora tracks, pandora vertices, and flashes described in Section \ref{sec:reco}. 

%\noindent \paragraph{Beam Windows} An important first step is to understand the beam window locations. These boundaries are different for each sample and are necessary for imposing a flash analysis cut in time with the beam spill.  The OnBeam and OffBeam windows are offset due to differing trigger condition configurations. Specifically, OffBeam has a configured delay between the trigger time and the beginning of the waveform of 400 ns larger than OnBeam. Note that the cosmic samples contain an exponential feature near the trigger. This is due to late light from cosmic interactions occurring before the trigger which causes a flash pile up near the beginning of the window. More detail on distribution features is discussed externally \cite{bib:davidcpot}. These windows are shown in Figure \ref{fig:misc_beamwindows} and summarized in Table \ref{tab:windows}.

\paragraph{Flash Cuts}

The first analysis cut in the CC Inclusive Selection requires that there be a flash of 40 PE or greater in the beam window. The highest PE flash per event is shown per neutrino interaction in MicroBooNE Simulation in Figure \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_numPE}a. A zoom into the low PE region in Figure \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_numPE}b shows that this cut has a stronger effect on our background distributions than on signal. This effect is largely due to the FV requirement: interactions tend to have higher reconstructed PE flashes when they occur directly in front of the PMT array (in the FV), rather than in the surrounding regions. However, a known bug in the scintillation modelling in current simulation causes an underestimatation of light production in the MC sample we employ here.  Thus, to minimize the impact of this bug, we have opted for a conservatively loose cut of 40 PE with mind to re-assess when new simulation samples are available.  A data-MC comparison of highest PE flash is shown in Figure \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_numPE_datamc}.

% FUTURE ADD: Flash match diagram
%A more sophisticated flash-matching technique of minimizing the observed flash PE distribution with respect to optical simulation hypothesis for each candidate track is in progress and will be used in future iterations of CC Selection \cite{bib:marco_selection}.

\par We next move to matching candidate tracks to the flash we just identified.  Flash matching considers the weighted-PE $z$ position of the highest PE flash found in the event as well as the start and end $z$ points of all candidate tracks. As example of weighted-PE $z$ calculated is shown in Figure \ref{fig:flash_graphic}.  The distance between the weighted PE flash $z$ position and the start or end of the track must be $\leq$ 70 cm in order for the track to pass. If the weighted $z$ position of the flash is between the start and end point of a candidate track, the distance is set to 0 cm. A data-MC comparison for this cut can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_flashtrkdist}a, with background distributions in Figure \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_flashtrkdist}b.  A zoom in on the lower-distance region can be found in Figures \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_flashtrkdist_zoom}a and b.

\paragraph{Track-Vertex Association + $\frac{dE}{dx}$ Correction}
At this point we have a preliminary set of candidate $\mu^-$ tracks that have been matched to a $\geq$ 40 flash in the beam window. We next want to associate these flash-match candidates tracks with candidate vertices in the event. This is done by comparing the distance between the start (or end) of each track with each candidate vertex. If this distance is less than 3 cm, a track-vertex association is built.  The number of tracks associated to each vertex at the end of this procedure is called the ``observed vertex multiplicity''; a data-MC comparison and a break down of backgrounds at this vertex-association stage are shown in Figures \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_vtxtrackdist}a and b.  The (unstacked) multiplicity distributions after this association are shown in Figures \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_mult} a (normal) and b (log).

\par At this stage, we have a rough set of candidate neutrino interactions. Our main goal now is to mitigate the cosmic contribution to this candidate pool, and select events that contain a charged-current neutrino interaction. A variable that can be used to separate cosmic from neutrino backgrounds is the energy deposition over distance.  This quantity is most useful in the case of a stopping cosmic ray muon, which will exhibit a Bragg peak near the decay point of the interaction.  The $\frac{dE}{dx}$ is calculated by applying a lifetime correction with electron lifetime 1 s to the charge deposition per wire pitch, or $\frac{dQ}{dx}$. A recombination correction derived from the ``Box Model'' at a field of 273 $\frac{V}{cm}$ is also applied \cite{bib:argoneut_recomb}. The $\frac{dQ}{dx}$ per track-associated-hit, per plane, is calculated by taking the integral (in ADC's) of each contributing reconstructed hit, and dividing it by the pitch (wire spacing divided by dot product of the 3D track direction and wire plane direction). MicroBooNE's $\frac{ADC}{cm}$ to $\frac{e^-}{cm}$ conversion constants are extracted on a sample of stopping muons by the calibrations team.
%To convert this $\frac{dQ}{dx}$ from $\frac{ADC}{cm}$ to $\frac{e^-}{cm}$, we apply calibration constants extracted on a sample of stopping muons by the MicroBooNE calibrations team.
\par Before we examine ways to use the $\frac{dE}{dx}$, we consider two additional points. First, sometimes charge is missed by reconstruction or lost due to dead or noisy wires in the detector. Thus, to ensure we utilize the maximum available information about each reconstructed track, we only consider the $\frac{dE}{dx}$ in the plane which has the most track-related hit information; we call this the ``best plane''. A breakdown of signal and background distributions for best plane is shown in Figure \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_bestplane}. There we see that plane 2 tends to be the best plane for all neutrino interactions, while planes 0 or 1 tend to be best for cosmics.  This is due to the fact that the collection plane (plane 2) wires are vertical.  Because neutrino interactions are forward going, they tend to spread out over the most wires in plane 2, causing the most hits to be identified at the reconstruction stage. Cosmics, on the other hand, are downard going and on average spread energy over more wires in planes 0 or 1 (+-60 degrees tilts to the vertical), than in plane 2.

\par Second, we note that our simple 1D calibration to go from $\frac{ADC}{cm}$ to $\frac{e^-}{cm}$ doesn't take into account variations of $\frac{dQ}{dx}$ over drift distance. We thus perform an intermediate calibration to correct the $\frac{dE}{dx}$ in the selected plane for any location in drift. We choose to shift to a value that already aligns fairly well with the current distributions to avoid distorting our results more than necessary.  These corrections are found by first considering the MC $\frac{dE}{dx}$ vs x distributions of all candidate tracks in Figure \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_mc_dedx_v_x}. In particular, we look at the collection plane. We empirically determine the peak value of the uncorrected, but mostly-flat-over-x, collection plane view to be 1.63 $\frac{MeV}{cm}$.  With our chosen baseline in hand, we proceed by fitting a line to the $\frac{dE}{dx}$ vs $x$ distributions and shifting the distributions using the baseline in conjunction with this fit. These correction equations as a function of x are summarized for all three samples in Table \ref{tab:dedx_corr}. Examples of these before- and after-correction distributions for all three planes of MicroBooNE simulation are shown in Figure \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_mc_dedx_v_x}, OnBeam in Figure \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_onbeam_dedx_v_x}, and OffBeam in Figure \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_offbeam_dedx_v_x}. The corresponding corrected 1D distributions are shown in Figure \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_1d_dedx_v_x}.

At this point, we have a set of candidate interactions with different multiplicities and energy deposition information.  We now subject these interactions to a series of cuts determined by multiplicity, in order to take advantage of multiplicity-specific features. Analysis cuts at this stage are determined empirically to maximize CC single $\pi^0$ selection while also minimizing cosmic contamination. These cuts are described in detail below.
\clearpage
\paragraph{Multiplicity 1 Cuts}
% Why so many single track cosmics passing the FV cut? Are they mainly broken/ mis-reconstructed?
Multiplicity 1 events are most affected by the cosmic background because they topologically resemble crossing or stopping cosmic ray muons. To account for this, we require that the candidate track be fully contained in the FV; this cut removes most exiting and entering cosmics that are well reconstructed. The FV used here is 20 cm from the boundaries in X and Y, and 10 cm from the boundaries in Z. To further limit cosmic contamination from tracks broken during reconstruction, tracks that pass dead regions of the detector, and mis-reconstructed tracks, we consider that most crossing muons will have a long projection in the vertical direction.  To handle these interactions, we first cut all candidate tracks with a cos($\theta$) of $>$ 0.4 and a length of candidate track $<$ 15cm. 1D distributions of these cut are shown in Figures \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_mult1_cosy}a, b and Figures \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_mult1_len}a, b. Note that these cuts, particularly that on cos($\theta$), remove a significant fraction of cosmic contamination, and shift the dominant background in the multiplicity 1 category to CC-0$\pi^0$. 2D distributions showing the effect of these cuts for CC 1$\pi^0$ signal and various backgrounds are shown in Figure \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_mult1_len_v_cosy}. On and OffBeam distributions are shown in Figure \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_onbeam_mult1_len_v_cosy}.

\par The majority of the remaining cosmic contamination at this point consists of muons that stop or decay inside the FV.  These tracks deposit more energy near the $\mu$'s end (the Bragg peak) than along the rest of the length of the track (Figure \ref{fig:cut_ex_0}). Thus, we can use the projected length and the ratio of start to end $\frac{dE}{dx}$ as handles to identify cosmics. The start $\frac{dE}{dx}$ is calculated by averaging over the first 10 hits of the track in the best plane. A similar calculation is performed to calculate end $<\frac{dE}{dx}>$. We remove candidates with either a) a ratio $>$ 1.5 or b) a ratio $<=$ 1.5 and a projected track length less than 25cm.  1D distributions over these variation are shown in Figures \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_mult1_ratiodedx}-\ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_mult1_projylen}.  In these distributions we observe (as expected) that CC-0$\pi^0$ interactions dominate the sample at this cut stage. 2D distributions of all backgrounds are shown in Figure \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_mult1_dedxratio_v_leny}, and of On and OffBeam in Figure \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_onbeam_mult1_dedxratio_v_leny}.

In this graphic, a cosmic muon (red triangle) enters the detector and decays into a Michel electron (gray triangle). When it does so, it deposits more energy near the decay point than while it travelled.  Assuming the Michel electron is not mis-reconstructed as a track, the stopping muon’s candidate vertex will have multiplicity 1, and the Bragg peak will sit at the vertex. This contrasts with a neutrino-induced muon coming to rest in the detector (green triangle).  In this case, the higher energy deposition will be at the end of the muon track, away from the candidate vertex. }

\paragraph{Multiplicity $>$ 1 Cuts}
Cosmic tracks can be mistakenly reconstructed as higher multiplicity events when they are ``broken''. To minimize the contribution of these events to our sample, the first cut we consider is on the angle between the two longest neutrino candidate tracks.  This distribution is shown in Figure \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_cosangle}; we cut candidates with a cos($\theta$) $>$ 0.9.  After this cut is employed, the largest remaining cosmic contribution comes from crossing muons that interact in the detector and produce several secondary charged particles. An example of this topology is shown in Figure \ref{fig:cut_ex_2}.  To mitigate the contribution of these interactions to our sample, we consider instances in which the candidate $\mu$ track end point is higher in Y than the second longest track end point in Y (such as the example in Figure \ref{fig:cut_ex_2}).  In such instances, we cut candidates with a second longest track length $<$ 30 cm and a cos($\theta_y$) component of the candidate track of $>$ 0.65. The 1D distributions of each variable are shown in Figures \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_multgt1_tracklen1} and \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_multgt1_dcosy}.  2D distributions of signal and background are shown in Figure \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_multgt1_len_v_cosy}; corresponding data distributions are shown in Figure \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_onbeam_multgt1_len_v_cosy}.

\paragraph{Multiplicity 2 Cuts}
Multiplicity 2 events pass first through the previous set of cuts for interactions with multiplicity $>$ 1, and are thus already a reduced sample. We now apply an additional set of cuts to mitigate the remaining population of multiplicity 2 candidates formed by stopping cosmic muons and their Michel electrons. Michel electron reconstruction-as-a-track occurs sometimes because these low energy showers tend to be fairly linear.  Thus our current algorithms sometimes mistake them for track activity.  In these background events, the vertex candidate is at the stopping point of the muon, and is assumed to be the start point of a neutrino interaction. We require one of two conditions be met: in the first condition, we check that the smaller of the two tracks be greater than 30 cm (Figure \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_mult2_secondtrklen}). If the smaller track satisfies this condition, the event passes the multiplicity 2 cuts. If the event does not pass the track length cut, we consider an additional set of conditions before filtering the event.  The second set of conditions considers the $<\frac{dE}{dx}>$ at the assumed start of the track (Figure \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_mult2_dedxst}), $<\frac{dE}{dx}>$ at the assumed end (Figure \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_mult2_dedxend}), and the end point of the candidate $\mu$ (Figure \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_mult2_endy}).  In the case of a stopping muon, the start $<\frac{dE}{dx}>$ will be larger than the end $<\frac{dE}{dx}>$, and the end point of the candidate track will be high in Y in the TPC (Figure \ref{fig:cut_ex_1}).  Thus, in the second set of conditions we require that the end point of the candidate $\mu$ track is $<=$ 96.5 cm in Y and that either 1) the start $<\frac{dE}{dx}>$ of the candidate track is less than the end, 2) the start $<\frac{dE}{dx}>$ is $<=$ 2.5 $\frac{MeV}{cm}$ or 3) the end $<\frac{dE}{dx}>$ is $>=$ 4 $\frac{MeV}{cm}$. The corresponding 2D distributions are shown in Figures \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_mult2_dedx_v_dedx} and \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_onbeam_mult2_dedx_v_dedx}.

%\par A table with event rates scaled to the non-blind 4.92e19 OnBeam POT is shown for OnBeam, OffBeam, and Simulation in Table \ref{tab:sel2_event_rates}. We focus specifically here on the final two columns, where we can draw conclusions from direct data to simulation comparison. There are a number of interesting features in this table.  First, the scaled number of ``No Cuts'' interactions before any cuts have been applied show a disagreement in row 1 of Table \ref{tab:sel2_event_rates}.  One potential cause for this discrepancy is our modeling of the light outside the TPC.  If it is too low, our PMTs in simulation will not see TPC-external interactions and be removed by the software trigger described in section blah. We will handle this possibility when we consider detector systematic variations at the end of this document.  Another feature worth noting in the last two columns of this table is the excess of Simulation over Data at the final stage of the Selection. To understand this further, an external study showed that the simulation and data can be brought into agreement by modifying our GENIE simulation. We do this by including scaling for quasi-elastic events in $q_0 -- q_3$ space to account for nuclear screening (roughly 5\% reduction in QE events), suppressed non-resonant single charged pion production down by 75\%, reduced resonant single charged pion production by 10\%, and scale down by 50\% the empirical MEC contribution.

\subsection{ Minimally Ionizing Particle (MIP) Consistency Cuts}

CC Inclusive Selection up until this point selects too many $\nu_e$ interactions for us to unblind more than the open 4e19 POT of data according to the MicroBooNE blinding policy. We thus consider two additional cuts here to comply with blinding policy for a run over MicroBooNE's 1.8e20POT of Run I data.  These cuts are considered in extensive detail externally, and discussed only briefly here in the context of the CC $\pi^0$ analysis \cite{bib:jz_unblinding_note}.

The pink circle is the candidate vertex, and the pink line is the candidate track. a) In this event, the candidate track is a proton; this type of $\nu_e$ forms the majority of $\nu_e$ contamination in the CC Inclusive sample; b) Class of events where the candidate is a track mis-reconstructed over a shower. }
\label{fig:mip_ex_len_angular}
\end{figure}


\par To begin, we observe that the majority of $\nu_e$ contamination in our sample is the result of a candidate track produced by a proton, rather than a muon (Figure \ref{fig:mip_ex_len_angular}a). Protons are shorter than muons and also highly ionizing while muons are minimally ionizing. Thus, we first consider a cut on candidate track length at 40 cm and on truncated mean $\frac{dQ}{dx}$ at 70000 $\frac{e^-}{cm}$ on the collection plane. These cuts aim to identify events in which the candidate $\mu$ is not consistent with a MIP hypothesis, as in the case of a proton. 1D distribution of these cuts are shown in a format similar to the previous section in Figures \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_multall_len} and \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_multall_dqdx}. Note that there is a bump in the $\frac{dQ}{dx}$ distribution at low values of $\frac{elec}{cm}$; this is due crossing tracks that are near-perpendicular to the anode plane.  2D distributions are shown for signal and all backgrounds in Figure \ref{fig:cutjust_mip_2d}.  Note that the majority of NC events lie in the region we're cutting, as most of the candidate tracks for these events are also actually protons. These cuts thus play a large role in mitigating the NC background.

\label{fig:cutjust_mip_2d}
\end{figure}

We consider one additional cut before proceeding to the results the CC Inclusive Selection filter.  Much of the $\nu_e$ population remaining after the MIP consistency cuts have a candidate $\mu$ track that is mis-reconstructed across a shower or across several particles (Figure \ref{fig:mip_ex_len_angular}b).  This causes the angular deviation of the track to be higher on average than a well-reconstructed candidate.  We thus consider a cut on maximum angular deviation of the candidate track.  This angular distribution for all events left after the default CC Inclusive Selection is shown in Figure \ref{fig:cutjust_sel2_multall_deviation}.  The implementation of this cut and the MIP consistency cuts brings our selected $\nu_e$ below the required number in the blinding scheme \cite{bib:jz_unblinding_note}. Although the data results of unblinding are not included in this document, they will be included in the eventual publication of this work.

%\section{Track-like Hit Removal}
\section{Shower Reconstruction}
During past efforts, 2D-clustering has been a bottle neck in the reconstruction chain where we lose many events due to the complexity of reconstructing complicated topologies. To mitigate this problem, we have broken 2D-clustering into 2 stages: track-like hit removal and clustering. We discuss both stages in this section.

\subsection{Identifying Electromagnetic Activity}
%At this point, we have identified a sample of CC $\nu_\mu$ candidate events. We must next look for CC events that also contain a single $\pi^0$ originating from the candidate vertex. $\pi^0$ identification is performed over several stages: first we identify electromagnetic activity at the hit level. The goal of this stage is to clean up the event. Second, we run image-based clustering and shower reconstruction algorithms on the remaining electromagnetic-like hits. Finally, once our events have 3D reconstructed showers, we apply a series of correlation and parameter cuts to identify candidate $\gamma$ daughters from the original $\pi^0$.  These stages will be discussed across the next 2 sections.

Hit Removal is a suite of algorithms developed by a MicroBooNE collaborator to identify electromagnetic activity at the hit level and store this information for use by downstream algorithms. While the package is called ``Hit Removal", no hits are ever actually removed from the event; rather, a track or shower-like designation is stored per hit in the hit's ``GoodnessOfFit'' class variable. Thus, at the end of all Hit Removal algorithms, both the identified electromagnetic hits and all original hits can be accessed. A brief overview is discussed in this section; extensive detail on all algorithms is provided externally \cite{bib:davidc_hitremoval}.

\par The goal of these algorithms is to identify induced charge which is both shower-like and originating at the candidate vertex in the event. This hit-identification is broken into cosmic-induced and neutrino-induced stages.  In both stages, only hits within a 1~m Region Of Interets (ROI) of the reconstructed vertex are considered. An example ROI is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:roi}. The cosmic-induced hit identification algorithms are run first.  Here, the hits associated with pandora cosmic-tagged tracks are `removed'.  Similarly, we remove groups of hits that are poorly aligned with the neutrino vertex, whether or not that charge already has a pandora cosmic tag. Finally, we search for remaining electromagnetic hits near in 2D space to already-removed cosmic clusters. If the detected activity resembles a delta ray, these hits are also removed. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{Cluster_Shower/Misc_ROI.png}
\caption{$\pi^0$ Region Of Interest (ROI) around $\nu_\mu$ CC CC Inclusive Selection tagged  vertex. The bounds extend 1m away from the vertex in each direction. }
\label{fig:roi}
\end{figure}

\par We follow these cosmic-targeted algorithms with a suite of algorithms aimed at neutrino-induced activity. First, pandoraCosmic clusters that have associated hits within 3.5 cm of the vertex are required to satisfy an aggressive tight truncated local linearity (TLL) requirement. The goal of this tight cut on linearity is to preserve the population of photons that convert very near the vertex, while also removing some vertex-related track activity. Following this aggressive TLL requirement, we consider number of cluster hits, cluster 2D slope, and the TLL variable with aim to remove $\mu$ and charged $\pi$ activity. Finally, we remove all charge within 3.5 cm of the vertex. Hits are generally crowded near the vertex, which leads to potential over-merging at the clustering stage. In this context, this step cleans the area around the vertex, and prepares us for downstream clustering. Once these algorithms have completed, the remaining electromagnetic hit candidates are passed onto clustering. The remaining hits after this hit removal pass are shown in red in Figure \ref{fig:hitremoval} for two separate example events. 
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\fbox{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Cluster_Shower/HR_mcc8.png}}
\caption{ Example display after Hit Removal, remaining candidate electromagnetic activity in red for two separate events. Note in the interaction on the right that the relatively linear shower (circled) has been removed. The effects of energy loss at all stages are quantified externally \cite{bib:davidc_missingE}.} 
\label{fig:hitremoval}
\end{figure}

\subsection{OpenCV Software Package}
OpenCV is an open source computer vision library with functionality to aid in pattern recognition and image processing \cite{bib:opencv}. These functions have been developed by a world-wide community and are designed to be both efficient and fast. OpenCV has Python, C++, and Java interfaces, and is easy to use. We utilize a number of OpenCV image-manipulation algorithms here to reconstruct our $\pi^0$ shower candidates.  %Here we describe algorithms developed to identify $\pi^0$ candidate showers in MicroBooNE data. 

\subsection{LArOpenCV Framework}
LArOpenCV is a C++ framework with an interface to the OpenCV API. The LArOpenCV framework allows for event-by-event image creation, application of image manipulation algorithms, two dimensional contour matching between three physical wire planes, and cluster creation and output. The input into LArOpenCV is either a full readout or region of interest (ROI) reconstructed hit object. Input data products are first translated into an ``event image'' and then handed over to a separate manager class for image processing. In this work, we consider reconstructed information inside an ROI around the CC Inclusive Selection candidate vertex.  

\subsection{Event Image}
\par In order to process hit objects as input with our LArOpenCV framework, we first need to translate our data products into a data format compatible with OpenCV. To do this, the LArOpenCV framework creates a single channel image for each plane determined by the wire and time tick ranges. Each row pixel represents a single wire and each column pixel a single time tick. The integral charge of each hit is scaled to 8 bits (integer 0 to 255) and assigned to that hit's peak time and wire. The result is a single channel grey-scale image. Note that this scaling is solely for the purposes of identifying clusters at the OpenCV stage. All analysis post-clustering (including energy reconstruction) is entirely independent of OpenCV and the LArOpenCV framework. 
\par Finally, we ``pool" the image. In MicroBooNE, a single time tick corresponds to 0.05 cm and a single wire spacing to 0.3 cm (or roughly 6 time ticks).  In ``pooling'', we combine 6 ticks into 1 tick pixel with the summed pixel value at that location. We do this because the image manipulation kernels we will describe in the coming sections perform better for our purposes if they can act uniformly in both directions. Now that the image is prepared, we can proceed with clustering.
\subsection{Clustering with LArOpenCV }

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Cluster_Shower/Misc_opencv_polar.png}
\caption{ Example from OpenCV manual depicting polar transformation algorithm \cite{bib:linearPolar}}

\begin{figure}[h!]

\caption{ Example of a single particle $\pi^0$ event in linear (left) and polar (right)}
\label{fig:pi0_polar}
\end{figure}

\par The job of the first algorithm in the clustering chain (``PolarCluster") is to identify candidate clusters for eventual particle identification. The algorithm first transforms image information into polar coordinates using the OpenCV linearPolar function \cite{bib:linearPolar}, with the origin at the reconstructed vertex location and the radius set to the ROI width (Figure \ref{fig:polar} and \ref{fig:pi0_polar}). Any pixels outside this region (for example, if the radius extends outside the TPC) are set to 0. This polar strategy has the advantage over Cartesian algorithms in that it enforces an image blur in the direction of showering which prevents lateral over-merging. Following translation, we perform a series of OpenCV image manipulations as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:sbc}. First, we dilate the image \cite{bib:dilate}. We do this using an elliptic structuring element \cite{bib:structuringElement} 5 pixels in radius as our kernel. During dilation, pixels surrounding each hit within the dilation radius acquire the grey scale value of the hit; the fundamental pixel dimensions, however, remain the same. In this way, we begin to connect hits without changing the size of the image. We then apply a blur function \cite{bib:blur} with kernel width 10 and height 5. Blurring smears these dilated hits together with a Gaussian filter and smooths image edges. This process, similar to dilation, only changes the grey scale values of various pixels, not the size of the original pixels. Finally, we run contour finding \cite{bib:contourFinding} on the blurred image, and initialize our cluster definitions based on these contours' spatial locations and geometric properties.  Once contours are found, we translate back into Cartesian coordinates and pass the acquired cluster information to the next algorithm.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Cluster_Shower/Misc_image_manipulation.png}
\caption{ a) Original hits that make up a single cluster; b) Dilate pixels to ``connect" nearby hits; c) Blur image to smooth edges and smear charge; d) OpenCV contour finding on blurred image produces a polygon which now encloses the original hits.}
\label{fig:sbc}
\end{figure}

\par Once our first candidate clusters have been identified, we remove very small clusters ($<$ 10 hits); the rational for this cut is motivated by the matching stage and will be discussed later.  

%This corresponds to five radiation lengths beyond the first conversion length which means that little energy will pierce this boundary (Figure \ref{fig:davidc_conversion_distance}). Thus, reconstructed clusters extending outside the ROI are unlikely candidates for our $\gamma$ search. We only consider information in this ROI around the CC Inclusive Selection candidate vertex throughout the remainder of the clustering chain.

%\label{fig:davidc_conversion_distance}
%\end{figure}

\par For the remaining clusters, a start point and direction is assigned. Start point calculation is performed in the following way: each OpenCV-calculated contour has an associated minimum bounding box \cite{bib:minAreaRect} that surrounds it (outer red rectangle in Figure \ref{fig:misc_opencv_startpoint}a). The start point finding module segments this bounding box into 2 equal segments long ways (red center line in Figure \ref{fig:misc_opencv_startpoint}a). The algorithm then locates the hit of the cluster that is closest to the ROI vertex (green circle).  Next, we take the segment this hit belongs to (green box in Figure \ref{fig:misc_opencv_startpoint}b) and search for the hit furthest from the center (yellow dot) of the minimum bounding box to assign a start point (purple star in Figure \ref{fig:misc_opencv_startpoint}c). Finally, the hit furthest from the center in the adjacent segment is assigned to be the end point (orange star in Figure \ref{fig:misc_opencv_startpoint}c). We assign the cluster's direction to be the direction of the cluster's minimum bounding box.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{Cluster_Shower/Misc_opencv_startpoint_explanation.png}
\caption{ a) The start point finding algorithm uses the ROI vertex (green circle) to determine the
cluster’s nearest hit to the vertex; b) The segment containing this hit (green) is then selected; c) The
start point (purple star) is assigned to the hit furthest from the center of the bounding box (yellow
dot), and likewise the end point in the other segment (orange star). }
\label{fig:misc_opencv_startpoint}
\end{figure}

\par Now that our clusters have start points and directions we can attempt to combine charge which was not clustered together during polar clustering. The algorithm we use to do the merging proceeds in a series of steps.  First, we consider all remaining clusters per plane (Figure \ref{fig:misc_flashlights}a) and again calculate the minimum bounding rectangles. The bounding points farthest from the reconstructed vertex are considered to be the `end' of this rectangle, where as the points closest are the `start'.  We then build a trapezoid of height 13 cm (h) that fans out 20 degrees ($\theta$) away from the direction of the box, and stick it on the end of the original bounding box (Figure \ref{fig:misc_flashlights}b); these values were chosen empirically to maximize first, the purity and second, the completeness on a sample of CC $\pi^0$ interactions.  The results of this operation are objects that resemble flash lights around each cluster per plane (Figure \ref{fig:misc_flashlights}c). We next sort the clusters based on their proximity to the vertex and loop over the sorted clusters. Per cluster in this outer loop, we then consider the overlap between it and all other thus-unassociated clusters in an inner loop.  We do this by looking for overlaps between the flash piece (segments 2-3-4-5 from Figure \ref{fig:misc_flashlights}b) of the closer-to-vertex cluster with the base (segments 5-0-1-2 from Figure \ref{fig:misc_flashlights}b) of the further cluster. Care is taken to keep neighbor associations unique, and not double count cluster merges. Once all overlaps have been considered, the convex hull \cite{bib:convexHull} of all newly-associated cluster hits is calculated and stored (Figures \ref{fig:misc_flashlights}d and e). The start point of the old cluster closest to the ROI vertex is used as the start point for the new combined cluster, while the end point is reassigned to the new cluster hit furthest from the start point.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Cluster_Shower/flashlights.png}
\caption{ a) The flashlight merging algorithm is fed the vertex (cyan) and a set of clusters identified in the polar clustering stage; b) A trapezoid of angle $\theta$ and height h is attached to the end of the cluster, with the end being the side furthest from the vertex.  The new contour bounding box points are labeled for convenience; c) Flashlights are constructed only for identified clusters in the plane; d) Associations are built between flashlights based on overlap of their segments; e) The final bounding contour is the minimum contour that encloses all points.  }
\label{fig:misc_flashlights}
\end{figure}

\par Finally, we apply 2 simple filters to reduce the number of bad/uninteresting clusters passing on to matching. First, we remove any clusters which are not aligned well with the vertex.  We do this by considering the dot product of the cluster's direction with the direction vector from the vertex to the cluster's start point.  If this dot product is $>$ 0.71 or if the cluster start point is closer than 12 pixels to the vertex, the cluster is kept, where these values were determined empirically to minimize the removal of visually well-aligned clusters.  The latter condition prevents removing clusters that appear to have very misaligned directions by function of being near the vertex. This algorithm removes lingering cosmic rays and some mis-clustered hits. Second, we filter clusters whose surrounding contour contains the CC Inclusive Selection vertex (Figure \ref{fig:vertex_in_hull}). Occasionally when events are busy (e.g. a crossing cosmic muon through the interaction, a large amount of charge deposited, etc.) the flashlight algorithm will over-merge. A contained vertex is nearly always a good sign that over-merging has occurred.  

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Cluster_Shower/vertex_in_hull.png}
\caption{Example event targeted by the second simple filter we apply after merging. The selected vertex is shown as a yellow star, and the convex hull formed after merging is shown in red. Here, merging has joined two short tracks at the vertex, which has resulted in a vertex-contained-hull. }
\label{fig:vertex_in_hull}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Cluster Matching}
Before we can reconstruct showers and search for $\pi^{0}$'s, we must match clusters across planes.  In order to reconstruct showers, we need matched 2D clusters from at least two different planes. Here we require only two rather than three planes for matched pairs to be saved, where one of those planes must be the collection plane. This decision is based on the fact that clustering generally only goes well consistently in two of the three planes; dead wires, events with extra activity (noise), and poor reconstruction are often present in at least one plane. We require that one of the matched clusters come from the collection plane.  In order to choose the second plane (U or V), we assign an event-by-event score to the U and V plane correlated with the percentage of the ROI which is covered by ``dead'' or poorly-functioning wires.  
 To do this, we take the width of the ROI as the denominator and the sum of all dead wire ranges within the ROI as the numerator. The score is computed by subtracting this percentage-of-dead-wires-in-ROI ratio from 1; thus ROI's with few dead wires will have high scores, while ROI's with many will have low scores.  The clusters in the U or V plane with the highest plane score are passed on to matching. 

\par Matching utilizes the fact that time is a shared coordinate across planes and assigns scores to cluster pairs based on their agreement in time. We quantify this score using a measure denoted as the \texttt{Intersection over Union}, \texttt{IoU}. This quantity is defined as:
\begin{equation}
  {\rm IoU} = \frac{ \Delta t_1 \cap \Delta t_2  }{ \Delta t_1 \cup \Delta t_2 }
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\Delta t$ denotes the time-range associated to the peak time of each hit in a given cluster.  Clusters which do not overlap are assigned a score of -1, while those that do are assigned a score between 0 and 1, with 1 being perfect overlap. At the end of the consideration of all match permutations, the highest scores are used to create matched pairs until no clusters or viable matches remain. We require that there be at minimum a 25\% agreement in time, and a 20\% agreement in number of cluster hits in order for a match to be made. 
\par Finally, as noted earlier, we apply a cut on clusters with less than 10 hits. An example of the situation we're trying to avoid in applying this cut is shown in Figures \ref{fig:matching_ex_0} and \ref{fig:matching_ex_1}.  We want to prevent the scenario in which a cluster in one plane merges with a small, distant blob of charge, its true partner-cluster from the other plane does not merge with that same small blob of charge, and as a result the clusters are mismatched with some other cluster with which they now share a better time overlap (Figure \ref{fig:matching_ex_1}). Losing some charge and correcting for the energy loss later is better than dealing with mis-matched pairs.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Cluster_Shower/matching_ex_0.png}
\caption{Example event targeted by the cut on small clusters. Here we are considering planes 0 and 2 right after polar clustering (before any merging algorithms are run).  There is 1 shower, with the majority of the shower (green triangle) separated in space from the remaining bit of the shower (blue triangle).  Time is a shared coordinate across the planes, so while the angle may be different in different views, time will always line up (demonstrated below with t0 and t1 on the green cluster).  Now, because the green cluster has a steeper angle in plane 2 than in plane 0, the blue cluster appears closer to the green in plane 2.  These two clusters will likely be combined during flashlight merging.  However, the blue and green clusters in plane 0 are unlikely to be merged,  because they appear further apart. }
\label{fig:matching_ex_0}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Cluster_Shower/matching_ex_1.png}
\caption{After merging completes, plane 0’s green cluster goes from t0 $\rightarrow$ t1, and plane 2’s green cluster goes from t0 $\rightarrow$ t2. Now it appears that plane 2’s cluster has a larger time overlap with the middle track than with the green plane 0 cluster.  Thus, if this track has not been removed during hit removal, matching will likely go awry unless the tiny cluster is prevented from entered the pool of clusters to-be-merged.
 }
\label{fig:matching_ex_1}
\end{figure}


\subsection{3D Shower Reconstruction}
Shower reconstruction uses 2D information created during the previous matching stage to create one 3D object. 
\paragraph{3D Direction}  We rely here on the reconstructed 3D interaction vertex to reconstruct the 2D projections. The 2D direction is computed as the charge-weighted average vector sum of the 2D distance from the vertex to each hit in the cluster.
\begin{equation}
  \hat{p}_{\rm 2D} = \frac{1}{Q_{tot}} \sum_{i=0}^{N} (r_i - r_{\rm vtx}) \times q_i 
\end{equation}
With N denoting the number of hits in the cluster, $r_i$ the position of the hit, $q_i$ its charge, and $r_{\rm vtx}$ the position of the projected vertex. Given two 2D weighted directions, the 3D direction is calculated using geometric relations between the planes and clusters \cite{bib:larliteGeoHelper}. 

\paragraph{3D Start Point Reconstruction} We calculate the 3D start point by finding the 3D overlap position of the OpenCV reconstructed 2D start points of the matched pair of clusters. The time tick coordinates from each cluster are averaged to calculate a 3D shared time coordinate. The (Y,Z) coordinates are identified by the intersection between the wires associated with 2D start points.  Wires must intersect inside the TPC for a shower to be reconstructed.  An example of successful 3D shower reconstruction (projected back into 2D) is shown in Figure \ref{fig:showers}.

\begin{figure}[h!] %H]

\fbox{\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{Cluster_Shower/Misc_opencv_showerreco.png}}
\caption{3D reconstructed showers are projected back into 2D as a visualization tool to indicate whether or not shower reconstruction is successful. }
\label{fig:showers}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Shower Energy Reconstruction}
\label{sec:ereco}
\par In this section we will briefly describe the series of correction factors and constants applied to the raw charge to account for physical processes, detector and electronics effects. All correction factors are derived using information only from the collection plane.  More detail on the motivation for these constants can be found externally \cite{bib:davidc_energycalibration}\cite{bib:davidc_recomb}.

%\begin{itemize}
\paragraph{Electronics Gain} 
We begin by considering all collection plane hits associated to the shower.  Each hit's area represents the integrated ADC charge deposited on that wire at that point in time.  We convert that integrated charge from ADC to $e^-$'s by applying an electronics gain factor of 198 $e^-$ / ADC. More detail on the calculation of this constant can be found externally in MicroBooNE's noise paper ~\cite{bib:noise}.  
\noindent The gain calibration values are different for data. In this case, we convert to $e^-$s by applying a value of 243 $e^-$ / ADC.  This factor is extracted from a sample of stopping muons and applied for both data samples.   
%Here we utilize David C’s extracted constants from a sample of stopping muons.  The gain factor is 198 $\frac{e}{ADC}$ in MC and 243 $\frac{e}{ADC}$ in data. See Ref.~\cite{bib:davidc_energycalibration_gain} for more detail on the extraction of this factor.
\paragraph{ Lifetime Correction} No lifetime correction is applied due to the high measured Ar purity and electron lifetime in MicroBooNE data ~\cite{bib:purity}. 
\paragraph{Argon Ionization Work Function} We next convert our deposited electrons into an energy scale. To do this, we multiply our deposited electrons by the 23.6 $\frac{eV}{e}$ it takes to ionize a single electron in argon \cite{bib:ionization_per_electron}. 
\paragraph{Ion Recombination} Finally, we consider recombination.  A charged particle that traverses the liquid argon medium leaves a trail of ionized electrons and argon ions in its wake.  Some number of these electrons will recombine with argon ions rather than making it to the wire planes. This number depends on the local electric field and on $\frac{dE}{dx}$ of the ionizing particle. Here we apply a single, constant recombination correction of 0.423. This factor was obtained by assuming a fixed $\frac{dE}{dx}$ of 2.3 MeV/cm  and utilizing the Modified Box recombination model as parametrized by the ArgoNeuT collaboration ~\cite{bib:argoneut_recomb}, applied at MicroBooNE's electric field of 273 V/cm.  
%More detail on the extraction of this constant can be found externally \cite{bib:davidc_recomb}.

\paragraph{Summary - Calibration Constants}
The calibration constants used in shower energy reconstruction for the rest of the note are summarized below:
\begin{equation}
  C_{MC} = 198 \frac{e^-}{\rm ADC} \times 23.6 \times 10^{-6} \frac{MeV}{e^-} \times \frac{1}{1-0.423} = 8.10 \times 10^{-2} \frac{\rm MeV}{\rm ADC}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  C_{Data} = 243 \frac{e^-}{\rm ADC} \times 23.6 \times 10^{-6} \frac{MeV}{e^-} \times \frac{1}{1-0.423} = 9.94 \times 10^{-2} \frac{\rm MeV}{\rm ADC}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Shower Quality and Energy Correction}
%We begin by studying the reconstructed shower energy (via the shower's associated collection plane cluster).
We next consider the quality of the post-CC Inclusive Selection shower reconstruction discussed above.  Specifically, we first study the reconstructed energy of the shower via its associated collection-plane hits. To do this, we combine hits into 2D `mcclusters' in each plane using truth information.  An example of the resulting mcclusters in the collection plane is shown in Figure \ref{fig:mcclusters}. For the rest of this section we will only focus on mcclusters produced by $\pi^0$'s. Cluster `purity' is defined to be the number of hits in the reconstructed cluster associated to the mccluster with the largest overlap in hits over the total hits of the reco cluster. Cluster `completeness' is defined to be the number of hits in the reconstructed cluster associated to the mccluster with the largest overlap in hits over the total hits of the mccluster. A pictorial example is shown in Figure \ref{fig:showerquality_purcompex}. In this example, each reconstructed cluster has both a purity and a completeness.  The purity of the purple reconstructed cluster is 100\% because the reconstruction has only included hits from one truth cluster (green). On the other hand, the red reconstructed cluster was over-merged, and ended up with hits from both the green and blue truth clusters.  Thus, the purity of the red cluster is less than 1. We likewise consider the completeness of each reconstructed cluster. The completeness tells us how much of the truth cluster the reconstruction has captured.  In both the case of the purple and the red reconstructed clusters, hits were missed during reconstruction. Thus the completeness for both is less than 1.  The purity and completeness of our sample of reconstructed showers are shown in Figure \ref{fig:showerquality_purcomp}. Note that a purity of zero indicates that a reconstructed shower shares no hits with any neutrino-induced $\pi^0$ cluster in the event.

\end{figure}

\par  Finally, each reconstructed shower is matched to the `mccluster' it shares the greatest overlap with in hits. We are now in a position to compare reconstructed shower energy to truth. This is an important step towards understanding both our resolution and bias. With an understanding of the bias, we can correct our energies to get a sense of scale in the downstream analysis. The results of this comparison are shown in Figure \ref{fig:showerquality_eres} with an empirical fit. We will use this empirical fit to correct our reconstructed shower energies in data and MC for the remainder of this analysis; these corrected energies will be calculated according to the equation
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ecorr}
E_{corr} = \frac{E_{reco}}{0.77} .
\end{equation}

\noindent We note that the corrected shower energy plays no role in the calculation of the cross section and only affects the kinematic distributions that are shown in later sections. Corrected plots will always be shown next to their uncorrected counterparts as a guide. 
\par The x = y line is included for reference and emphasizes the reconstructed energy bias away from truth. The contributions to this bias are (mainly) twofold. For one, roughly 10\% of the reconstructed energy is lost to hit thresholding and containment effects. The additional 15 \% is due to both the hit removal stage, where pieces of showers are sometimes excluded from clustering consideration, and clustering, where we sometimes miss hits. These bias are considered in detail externally \cite{bib:davidc_hitthresholding} \cite{bib:davidc_missingE}. Most events lie below the x = y line. The population of events above the line are instances of over-merging. This occurs when a reconstructed cluster is made up of two or more mcclusters and thus appears to have a higher energy than its associated truth cluster. We perform the same check in 1D in Figures \ref{fig:showerquality_eres_corr}a and b, with and without the corrected energy as described by Equation \ref{eq:ecorr}. The energy resolution observed here has two populations.  We explore the secondary bump away from 0 by considering single particle $\pi^0$ samples without and with cosmics.  When we do this, we see in the left of Figure \ref{fig:showerquality_eres_series} that the bump is absent from the resolution curve for single particle $\pi^0$ without cosmics.  The bump appears when we add cosmics in with the single particles (middle) and is accentuated further when we integrate neutrino-related track activity (right). This tells us that the bump is related to the presence of track-related activity.  During hit removal, hits associated with showers may be removed if they overlap with tracks.  The more track activity present in the event the more often this will happen, which is seen when we look at the CC $\pi^0$ + cosmics sample.

\end{figure}


To finish up our discussion of shower quality, we additionally consider shower start point resolution using the same MC-reco shower matches described above. We consider the MC shower start point to be the point of first energy deposition in the detector. The resulting resolutions are shown in Figure \ref{fig:showerquality_xyzres}. Note that start point resolution by itself is an imperfect metric for assessing the quality of shower reconstruction. Sometimes the trunk of the shower is very linear and removed during hit removal; in this case, the result is often a poor start point resolution, despite the shower being usable to identify the presence of a $\pi^0$. An example of this type of event is shown in Figure \ref{fig:showerquality_startpointoff}.  Note that this effect also contributes to the worse resolution seen in the Z coordinate in Figure \ref{fig:showerquality_xyzres}. As showers are generally forward going in z, but uniformly distributed in x and y, a removed trunk will most affect the z coordinate..

\subsection{Shower Reconstruction Efficiency}
Finally, we consider our shower reconstruction efficiency. This information will give us a sense of what kind of overall efficiency to expect at the final stage of selection. To do this, we consider all signal CC 1$\pi^0$ events that passed the CC Inclusive Selection + MIP consistency cuts. Of this sample, 3\% of the photons that originate from the $\pi^0$ decay convert outside the active TPC volume. Of the remaining showers that convert inside the TPC, we look at the shower energy dependent reconstruction efficiency. We define this efficiency to be the number of reconstructed showers that are matched to a true signal shower divided by the number of true signal showers. The results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:shower_reco_efficiency}.  The majority of the subleading shower population is below 100 MeV, where shower reconstruction efficiency drops below 50\%.  This is the main reason for the large number of signal events that have only one signal shower reconstructed, as we will see in the next subsection. In the past, we explored methods to perform a second pass reconstruction to increase our efficiency for subleading photons, but there was limited success \cite{bib:jz_catch_subleading}.  

\begin{figure}[h!]

\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{Cluster_Shower/shower_reco_efficiency.png}
\caption{Shower reconstruction efficiency after CC Inclusive Selection, with the subleading and leading energy distributions normalized to fit in the same plot.  }
\label{fig:shower_reco_efficiency}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Data - MC Shower Comparison}


In this section, we compare absolutely normalized shower reconstruction parameters between data and simulation. An important first step is to consider the number of showers reconstructed per event.  In Figure \ref{fig:physics_sel2_nshrs}, we see a large discrepancy in the 0 reconstructed showers bin, and better agreement for higher numbers of showers. It is difficult to draw a strong conclusion on the 0-bin disagreement due to the data-MC discrepancy observed at the CC Inclusive preselection stage, however, we note that we will only be focusing on events with at least 1 shower to tag $\pi^0$ candidates for the remainder of this note where the agreement is considerably better. Kinematic distributions related specifically to events with 0-showers reconstructed can be found in Appendix \ref{sec:AppC}.  An event mode breakdown for events with at least 1 reconstructed shower is shown in Figure \ref{fig:physics_gt0shower_eventtype}.

\end{figure}


\par We next consider the origin of the reconstructed showers in each bin in Figure \ref{fig:physics_sel2_nshrs}. These breakdowns are shown for 1 - 7 reconstructed showers in Figure \ref{fig:physics_sel2_nshr_background_breakdown}. As expected, most identified electromagnetic activity is due to a $\pi^0$. Occasionally, more than 1 reconstructed shower will correspond to the same truth shower; we discuss a cut on opening angle later to prevent these kinds of shower pairs from entering our final sample.

\label{fig:physics_sel2_nshr_background_breakdown}
\end{figure}


\par Finally, we consider reconstructed shower variables over data and simulation. Because this comparison naturally excludes events falling into the 0-shower bin in Figure \ref{fig:physics_sel2_nshrs}, we expect better data-MC agreement in these comparisons than at the CC Inclusive stage. We find the rates and shapes of reconstructed showers agree relatively well in start point and direction (Figures \ref{fig:physics_sel2_shr_x} - \ref{fig:physics_sel2_shr_z}), opening angle of the shower, the distance from the vertex to the shower start point (Figures \ref{fig:physics_sel2_shr_rl}a, b), energy and corrected energy (Figures \ref{fig:physics_sel2_shr_e}a, b).  Note that the conversion distance distribution in Figure \ref{fig:physics_sel2_shr_rl}b drops off at the ROI boundary of 1 m.  Because the ROI is a rectangle rather than a circle, we also get some spill over 1 m where showers have converted in the corners of the ROI.

\section{$\pi^0$ Selection} 

In this section we will use the reconstructed shower information we just created to identify events that contain a $\pi^0$ candidate. This is broken into two separate but complementary paths: one that considers all events with at least two reconstructed showers and another that considers all events with at least one reconstructed shower. There is a large overlap between these two final samples, but one is not a subset of the other. We discuss first the two shower selection.  

\subsection{Candidates With At Least Two Showers}
We begin by considering the breakdown of events with at least two reconstructed showers (Figure \ref{fig:physics_pi0_nshrs}).  We see that by requiring at least two showers, we reduce our sample size by 95\%, while also creating a highly signal-enriched selection. Pass rate and composition breakdowns after this at-least-two-showers requirement are shown in Tables \ref{tab:pi0_2showers_eventrates} and \ref{tab:pi0_2showers_composition}.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Before using this sample to extract a cross section, we consider two additional items. First, because we now have access to reconstructed shower information in addition to the information we had at the CC Inclusive stage, we re-classify background interaction types to be used in data-simulation comparison histograms. Second, we apply a series of checks and quality cuts to ensure that our selected sample maintains a low cosmic background and is well-reconstructed.

\subsubsection{Signal and Backgrounds for $\pi^0\rightarrow\geq 2 \gamma$}
The background breakdowns discussed throughout the note thus far were defined based on the truth-origin of the reconstructed candidate $\mu$ in conjunction with GENIE truth information. At this point, we have access to both the candidate $\mu$ and to our candidate showers.  Because of this new information, it's important that we re-classify all interactions in which at least 1 of the showers is of cosmic origin into a `cosmic' category to maintain a pure sample of signals. We describe these new backgrounds below and use them in the following data-MC comparison plots. However, for continuity with the previous discussion at the CC Inclusive stage, we will continue to present pass rate and composition tables using the backgrounds described at the beginning of the note. 

\paragraph{ Cosmics}
This category remains un-changed from the previously described background breakdowns.  It represents the OffBeam data contribution to the stack. 

\paragraph{ Cosmic + Neutrino}
Events previously tagged as ``Cosmic + Neutrino" enter this category automatically.  We next consider the truth origin of each candidate shower in our remaining sample.  If either candidate shower is of cosmic origin, we add the event to this category. %An example of this type of event is shown in Figure \ref{fig:backgrounds_cosmic_nuflash}.

\paragraph{ $\nu_\mu$ CC 1 $\pi^0$ } Our signal event classification in these plots is the same as before with one additional requirement: both reconstructed showers must be neutrino-induced.  All signals with cosmic-origin showers are reclassified as ``Cosmic + Neutrino" under this scheme.

\paragraph{$\nu_\mu$ CC Charge Exchange}
This background contains all instances of $\nu_\mu$-induced CC charge exchange outside of the initial neutrino interaction point in which both showers are of $\nu$-origin. An example of this interaction type in our final sample is shown in Figure \ref{fig:backgrounds_cc}a. 

\paragraph{$\nu_\mu$ CC Multiple $\pi^0$}
This background contains all instances of $\nu_\mu$-induced CC multiple $\pi^0$ production in which both candidate showers are of $\nu$-origin.  An example of this interaction type in our final sample is shown in Figure \ref{fig:backgrounds_other}b.

\paragraph{$\nu_\mu$ NC $\pi^0$}
This background contains all instances of $\nu_\mu$-induced NC $\pi^0$ production in which both candidate showers are of $\nu$-origin. Note that NC multiple $\pi^0$ events are included in this category.  An example of this interaction type in our final sample is shown in Figure \ref{fig:backgrounds_nc}d. 

\paragraph{ $\nu_\mu$ Final State Electro-Magnetic Activity ($\nu_\mu$ FSEM)}
Here we attempt to separate the remaining events into classifications of with and without electromagnetic activity in the final state.  Final State EM events are $\nu_\mu$ events in which both reconstructed showers are of $\nu$-origin, and at least one of these reconstructed showers is due to a $\nu$-induced true shower. This category contains, for example, proton and neutron inelastic scatters which produce EM showers (Figures \ref{fig:backgrounds_cc}b, c and Figures \ref{fig:backgrounds_nc}a, b), kaon decays (Figure \ref{fig:backgrounds_cc}d)),  interactions with 1 or more photons in the final state (Figure \ref{fig:backgrounds_cc}e), mis-reconstructed events where at least one reconstructed candidate is from a $\nu$-induced shower (Figure \ref{fig:backgrounds_cc}f), NC Charge Exchange (Figure \ref{fig:backgrounds_nc}a) and $\nu_\mu$ CC 1$\pi^0$ out of the FV (Figure \ref{fig:backgrounds_other}a).

\paragraph{Other}
This background contains all of what's left over after all other backgrounds have been assigned.  This includes $\nu_e$'s (Figure \ref{fig:backgrounds_other}c), $\overline{\nu_\mu}$'s, and all $\nu_\mu$ CC events with no EM activity in the final state.

\subsubsection{Tuning Selection for Events with Two Showers}
Now that we've incorporated reconstructed shower information into our background assignments, we clean up the sample with a few additional checks before calculating the cross section.  First, we consider the impact parameter of every 2 shower permutation. We do this for the backgrounds described in the previous paragraph, and additionally for a simplified break down.  In this additional background, the signal sample is defined the same.  The remaining non-signal events are broken into 2 kinds of backgrounds.  The first defined as events that are not signal, but have any number of $\pi^0$'s in the final state induced by the neutrino interaction. The second no neutrino-induced $\pi^0$'s.  Impact parameters are shown for this breakdownn in Figure \ref{fig:cutjust_pi0_IP}a, with a data-MC comparison in Figure \ref{fig:cutjust_pi0_IP}b.  We expect small impact parameters between most shower pairs, as the candidate vertex is used to reconstruct 3D direction. However, sometimes mis-matches are made, mis-reconstruction occurs, or clusters are under-merged resulting in an incorrect reconstructed direction; the effect of IP on angular resolution of our reconstructed showers can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:ex_cutjust_IP}a. The effect seems small at first glance, but when we propagate the effect through to the reconstructed 2-shower mass peak, we see that the poorer angular resolution of high IP events smears the mass plot towards lower energies (Figure \ref{fig:ex_cutjust_IP}b). Thus, a cut on impact parameter between showers is important to ensure both spatial correlation between showers, and higher quality angular resolution.  To be conservative, we choose here an impact parameter $\leq$ 4cm.

\end{figure}

\par We next consider the opening angle between reconstructed showers. Figure \ref{fig:mcvar_pi0_onlyoangle}a shows the true opening angle between showers of signal events from our full Simulation (black), and after CC Inclusive Selection (red). This distribution suggests that we expect few events to have a small true opening angle. Additionally, $\pi^0$ candidate pairs that have small reconstructed opening angles tend to be separately reconstructed showers from the same original true shower (Figure \ref{fig:mcvar_pi0_onlyoangle}b). This point is emphasized in Figure \ref{fig:comp_cutjust_pi0_OA} where we consider the completeness of leading and subleading shower candidate pairs as a function of opening angle. We see that low opening angle has a high correlation with low subleading shower completeness (middle plot), and with lower-than-average leading shower completeness (right plot). Thus, we choose a lower bound of 0.35 rad (20 degrees) to maximize the quality of our event sample without significantly damaging the efficiency. Opening angle is shown broken down by the sample definitions described in the previous paragraph in Figure \ref{fig:cutjust_pi0_OA}a, and with a data-MC comparison in Figure \ref{fig:cutjust_pi0_OA}b. % Finally, we consider conversion distances of both showers (Figures \ref{fig:cutjust_pi0_RL} \ref{fig:cutjust_pi0_low_RL}). We note the that there is very little separation power in this variable and also no reconstruction-related justification for a conversion distance cut. We thus do not employ a conversion distance cut at this time. We also do not include an energy or mass peak cut.

Finally, we consider the ``Cosmic + Neutrino" background contribution. This contribution is 11\% of our current sample. Because the cosmic contribution is modeled via MC systematics, we believe it is important to mitigate this background to avoid accruing a large uncertainty on the final cross section.  We begin by considering the raw reconstructed energy of both candidate showers for signal and Cosmic + Neutrino background. We find that there is separation power between the two samples when both reconstructed candidate shower energies are $<$ 40 MeV (Figure \ref{fig:cutjust_pi0_e}a).  We also observe that the conversion distance is relatively flat across the cosmic sample's candidate shower; thus, we additionally cut events where either the leading shower conversion distance is $>$ 80cm, or the subleading shower distance is $>$ 100cm (Figure \ref{fig:cutjust_pi0_e}b). When we implement these cuts, we find that the cosmic contribution to the 2-shower sample reduces to 5\%. This is a 50\% reduction is cosmic background, at the smaller cost of 6\% of signal. We are more confident at this stage that assessing a conservative 100\% uncertainty on this background will not overwhelm our final cross sectional uncertainties. A before and after of this cut is shown for shower conversion distance in Figure \ref{fig:physics_radl_before_after}a, b.
% If we assess a 100\% uncertainty on this background, we find that it adds an additional 18\% final fractional uncertainty on the cross section.

\par If a pair of showers passes all the criteria described thus far, they are considered to be a $\pi^0$ candidate. If more than one candidate pair is found per event, the event is neglected.  Ten candidate events selected from data at this point are shown in Figure \ref{fig:physics_pi0_onbeam_eventdisplays}.

\par It is worth noting that the reconstructed $\pi^0$ mass peak is displaced from the expected 135 MeV in Figure \ref{fig:physics_pi0_mass}. This bias is well understood to be the result of the multiple ways that we can lose energy during shower reconstruction. For one, some energy depositions at the wire planes are not large enough to be detected during hit reconstruction. This (in conjunction with containment) has a roughly 10\% effect on biasing the mass peak \cite{bib:davidc_hitthresholding}. Additionally, some amount of charge is lost during the hit removal and clustering stages of the chain.  This has been investigated externally to have a roughly 15\% effect \cite{bib:davidc_missingE}. When these effects are combined, we expect an energy bias of 25\%, and for the mass peak to sit around 100 MeV, which is in fact what we observe. 
\par The energy resolution is affected non-uniformly by each of these sources of energy loss. This can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:showerquality_eres_corr}b, where it is clear that a simple linear energy scale correction is not sufficient to recover most of the lost charge. For that reason we propose to not correct the shower energy in the culmination of this work into an eventual paper. One consequence of this is that we will not be able to produce a $M_{\pi^0}$ distribution, which naturally raises the question: how do we know the showers we are reconstructing are both photons and originating from a $\pi^0$ decay? We can address the first element of this question by considering the conversion distance in Figure \ref{fig:physics_pi0signalonly_mass}a.  Here we see that a fit to the data returns a conversion distance of 24 $\pm$ 12 cm; this is in agreement with the expected value of 25 cm for photons at our energies, suggesting that we are in fact selecting photons. We can confirm these photons are originating from $\pi^0$'s by considering the reconstructed two shower mass peak (Figure \ref{fig:physics_pi0signalonly_mass}b).  As noted earlier, the mass peak is offset due to the multiple sources of energy loss in our current reconstruction chain. Thus, to verify that the two-shower “mass” distribution follows our expectation we consider the result of reconstructing a sample of single-particle $\pi^0$’s with and without cosmics. For an apples to apples comparison, we additionally smear the vertex location of the single particle samples according to the vertex resolution after the CC Inclusive Selection.  The agreement between the peak location and shape between the signal and the single particle samples agrees within statistical uncertainty, and improves as we move from the sample without to the sample with cosmics. We believe this is a sufficient indication that we are selecting $\pi^0$'s in our interactions.

\subsubsection{A Closer Look at Sample Composition for $\pi^0\rightarrow\geq 2 \gamma$}
A detailed breakdown of the final selected sample is described in Table \ref{tab:pi0_obnox_breakdown}.  As discussed earlier, we assign all interaction types with cosmic-origin showers to the cosmic category.  However, thus far we have not otherwise investigated the origin of the `showers' in our candidate pool.  We examine the shower origin content of each non-Cosmic `Sample Composition Category' in Figure \ref{fig:physics_showerOriginBreakdown_mass}.  In Figure \ref{fig:physics_showerOriginBreakdown_mass}a, we see that 93\% of our signal is composed of events with 2 neutrino-induced $\pi^0$ showers (salmon). There is a similar trend in our $\pi^0$-dominated backgrounds ($\nu_\mu$ CC CEx, $\nu_\mu$ Mult $\pi^0$, $\nu_\mu$ NC $\pi^0$) in Figures \ref{fig:physics_showerOriginBreakdown_mass}c-e.  In Figure \ref{fig:physics_showerOriginBreakdown_mass}b, we get a mix of shower origins--the 2 $\nu$-induced showers shown in green are caused by $\eta$ decays, while the 2 neutrino-induced $\pi^0$ shower events are due to CC 1$\pi^0$ out of FV, NC Charge exchange, and Kaon decay. Finally, the `Other' category shows a mix.  The 2 $\pi^0$ shower contribution here is due to $\nu_e$ and $\overline{\nu_\mu}$, while the the remaining yellow background is due to tracks mis-reconstructed as showers in CC events.

\subsection{Candidates With At Least One Shower}
In this section, we consider the hypothesis that any neutrino-induced photon originating from the vertex indicates the presence of a $\pi^0$.  This strategy will allow us access to the single-reconstructed shower events, and give us a chance to regain a significant chunk of events. More detail on the one-shower hypothesis exists externally \cite{bib:timb_singleshower}.
\par As mentioned in an earlier section, by requiring at least 2 showers we reduce our sample size by 95\%.  However, this 95\% reduction includes roughly 50\% of the remaining signal after the CC Inclusive Selection filter has completed. This chunk of signals with only one reconstructed shower is largely the result of our low shower reconstruction efficiency for sub-leading photons, shown earlier in Figure \ref{fig:shower_reco_efficiency}. Below 100 MeV of deposited shower energy, the shower reconstruction efficiency drops below 50\%, which results in a number of signal events with only 1 reconstructed shower. 
\par When we only require 1 shower be reconstructed in an event, we see the pass rate and sample composition change.  These values are shown Tables \ref{tab:pi0_1shower_eventrates} and \ref{tab:pi0_1shower_composition}. We see from these tables that, before any additional checks or cuts, our signal efficiency and purity are 26\% and 40\% respectively; this is in contrast to 11\% and 62\% efficiency and purity we saw in the corresponding two-shower Tables \ref{tab:pi0_2showers_eventrates} and \ref{tab:pi0_2showers_composition}.

%\subsection{Signal and Backgrounds for $\pi^0$ \rightarrow $\geq$ 2$\gamma$}
\subsubsection{Tuning Selection for Events with Single Shower}

Similar to how we tuned our 2-shower cuts, we begin here by breaking events into signal and background samples.  The sample definitions and background breakdowns are the same as described in the 2-shower selection section.  We next examine potential variables to use in the selection.  First, we consider the impact parameter of all showers with the vertex.  This is shown in Figure \ref{fig:cutjust_pi0_1shower_IP}a for the cut-tuning backgrounds, and with data-MC comparison in Figure \ref{fig:cutjust_pi0_1shower_IP}b. As noted earlier, we expect small impact parameters, as the vertex is used to reconstruct 3D direction. However, due to the effect on shower direction noted in the two-shower section, we choose to impose an impact parameter cut to improve the angular resolution of our candidate shower sample. To be conservative, we choose here an impact parameter $\leq$ 4cm. Next, we consider the conversion distance of the shower from the reconstructed vertex (Figure \ref{fig:cutjust_pi0_1shower_RL}a and b). Because there is some separation power in this variable, we employ a conversion distance cut of 62 cm.  Finally, if more than one reconstructed shower passes both previous cut, we select the higher energy shower as our shower candidate.  Recall that this is in contrast to the 2-shower path in which multiple-candidate-pair events were removed.

\par A summary of the passing rates for signal and all backgrounds is shown in Table \ref{tab:pi0_passrates}.  Note that the signal efficiency is significantly higher here in the one shower approach than in the two. This suggests that the one shower approach is a valuable handle on this additional pool of untapped events for extracting physics information. While the purity of the sample does take a hit for this selection, it is still competetive with measurements made by previous experiments (Table \ref{tab:history_ccpi0_results}). Sample composition is shown in Table \ref{tab:pi0_purity}.  Signal and background distributions are shown for a variety of kinematic variables in Figures \ref{fig:physics_singleshower_mulen} - \ref{fig:physics_singleshower_ip}.

\subsubsection{A Closer Look at Sample Composition for $\pi^0\rightarrow\geq 1 \gamma$} 
We again consider a detailed breakdown of the final selected sample of the single shower sample.  This breakdown is described in Table \ref{tab:singleshower_obnox_breakdown} and corresponds to the data-MC comparisons in this section. We see from this table that our sample is 56\% pure with our $\nu_\mu$ CC 1$\pi^0$ signal; this contrasts to the 67\% purity we observed previously along the 2-shower selection path.  We further examine the quality of this 56\% by considering the origin of each candidate shower in the signal sample in Table \ref{tab:singleshower_obnox_ccoth_breakdown}.  From row 3 in this table, we see that 97\% of our sample has a selected candidate shower that backtracks to a true $\nu$-induced $\pi^0$, with the majority of remaining tags due to tracks mis-reconstructed as showers. This indicates that we have selected a set of signal events with high quality, automated shower reconstruction.  Plots of signal and background as described in the `Sample Composition Category' in Table \ref{tab:singleshower_obnox_ccoth_breakdown} are shown in Figure \ref{fig:physics_showerOriginBreakdown_E}a-f. Example event displays of reconstructed showers that backtrack to $\nu$-induced showers and $\nu$-induced tracks are shown in Figure \ref{fig:ccoth_bkgd_nu_cos}.  We additionally include an example of a `noise'-originating shower in Figure \ref{fig:ccoth_bkgd_noise}, and finally a $\nu$-induced $\pi^0$ shower in Figure \ref{fig:cc1pi0_pi0}.

\section{Cross Section Analysis}
\par At this point we are in a position to calculate the cross section of $\nu_\mu$-induced CC 1-$\pi^0$ on argon.  Before we do so, it is important to understand whether we have introduced kinematical bias into the analysis at any stage.  In the following sections we will examine the analysis efficiencies across all stages and a variety of variables, as well as gathering all the pieces we need to calculating the final cross section.

\subsection{Truth and Efficiency Distributions}
This section considers the distributions and selection efficiencies across a variety of kinematic variables across the selection process.  The events considered in these plots are CC events with a single neutrino-induced $\pi^0$ originating from a true vertex contained in the FV. The efficiency is defined here to be the number of this kind of events at some stage (e.g. CC Inclusive Selection) divided by the number of this kind of event before any cuts have been applied.  Figures \ref{fig:pi0_effs_0} - \ref{fig:pi0_effs_6} show kinematic distributions and their corresponding efficiencies at each stage of our CC$\pi^0$ selection up through the 2-shower set of cuts.  We show a similar set of plots for the single shower set of cuts in Figures \ref{fig:pi0_effs_7} - \ref{fig:pi0_effs_13}. Given the flatness within statistical variation of the efficiency distributions described here, we conclude that we will not be kinematically biasing an absolute cross section measurement given the state of our current reconstruction and selection procedures. Only statistical uncertainties are considered here.

\subsection{Cross Section}

Our first step is to calculate the GENIE flux-averaged cross section on argon for our simulation. The cross section can be calculated according to the following equation:

\begin{equation}
  \sigma = \frac{N_{tagged} - N_{bkgd}}{\epsilon*N_{targ}*\phi}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $N_{tagged}$, $N_{bkgd}$ are the number of tagged events and background events respectively, $\epsilon$ is the efficiency, $N_{targ}$ the number of Argon nuclei targets and $\phi$ the flux. 
\par We use the previously the simulation sample used throughout this work to perform this initial calculation.  Because we are using MC information to calculate a true value here, we use $\epsilon$ = 1, $N_{bkgd}$=0 and $N_{tagged}$=$N_{signal}$.  To calculate $N_{signal}$, we choose our volume of interest to be the Fiducial Volume (FV) used by CC Inclusive Selection, with 20cm from the wall in X and Y, and 10cm from the wall in Z. We find $N_{tagged}$ = 7567, for signal interaction vertices inside the FV. 
\par Our next job is to calculate the number of targets in our FV:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:1}
  N_{targ} = \frac{\rho_{Ar} * V * Avogadro}{m_{mol}} 
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\rho_{Ar}$ is the density of Liquid argon, V is the volume of interest, and $m_{mol}$ is the number of grams per mole of argon.  Using the NIST database at our temperature and pressure for the density of liquid Argon, and the FV as our volume of interest, we find: 

\begin{align}
N_{targ} &= \frac{1.3836 [\frac{g}{cm^3}] * 4.246e7 [cm^3] * 6.022e23 [\frac{molec}{mol}]}{39.95 [\frac{g}{mol}]} \\\\
&= 8.855\times10^{29}~\text{molecular targets}
\end{align}

\par Our final step is to calculate the integrated flux.  We do this by integrating over the $\nu_\mu$ flux histogram (Figure \ref{fig:flux}a) provided by the Beam Working Group \cite{bib:flux}, and normalizing by the Protons On Target (POT) in our simulated sample; in this case, our POT is 4.232e20.  Using this POT, we calculate a total integrated flux of 3.02e11 $cm^{-2}$ over the full energy range of the flux histograms with $<E>$ = 824 MeV. 
\noindent Putting it all together we find:


\begin{align}
\sigma^{\text{MC}}_{CC\pi^0} &= \frac{7567}{3.02e11 \frac{1}{cm^2} * 8.855e29 Ar } \\\\
&= (2.83 \pm 0.03) *10^{-38} \frac{cm^2}{Ar}
\end{align}

\label{fig:flux}
\end{figure}

\noindent where the uncertainty presented is purely statistical and dependent only on the number of signal events.  

\par We perform a similar integration over the $\nu_\mu$ flux histogram (Figure \ref{fig:flux}b) in order to calculate the flux we'll need to measure a cross section on data. This integrated flux is 3.51e10 $cm^{-2}$ over the full energy range of the flux histograms with $<E>$ = 824 MeV.

\end{tabular}
\end{table*}

\par At this point, we summarize the information we'll need to calculate the cross section from data via both selection paths in Table \ref{tab:summary_of_xsec_params}. We can calculate the cross section using the 2-shower results described in the previous section where $N_{tag}$ is the number of OnBeam events at the final stage, and $N_{bkgd}$ is the number of scaled OffBeam and MC backgrounds :
\begin{align}
\sigma^{\text{Data}}_{CC\pi^0_{2\gamma}} &= \frac{69_{OnBeam} - 0_{OffBeam} - 24.18_{MCBkgd}}{0.056 * 3.51e10 \frac{1}{cm^2} * 8.855e29 Ar} \\\\
&= (2.56 \pm 0.50) *10^{-38} \frac{cm^2}{Ar}
\end{align}

This result is within statistical uncertainties of the true calculated cross section above. 

\par Finally, we can calculate the cross section using 1 shower-selection results on data:
\begin{align}
\sigma^{\text{Data}}_{CC\pi^0_{1\gamma}} &= \frac{257_{OnBeam} - 15.18_{OffBeam} - 102.07_{MCBkgd}}{0.17 * 3.51e10 \frac{1}{cm^2} * 8.855e29 Ar} \\\\
&= (2.64 \pm 0.33) *10^{-38} \frac{cm^2}{Ar}
\end{align}

This result is also within statistical uncertainties of the true calculated cross section above. These results are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:genie_uboone_xsec} on the GENIE extracted cross section plot.  Only statistical uncertainties are shown for now.

\section{Systematic Uncertainties}
The precision and sensitivity of an experimental measurement depends exactly on how well we understand the contributing models and detector limitations. In the case of MicroBooNE, the nominal cross section uncertainties in the GENIE neutrino generator, modeling of the beam flux, and detector systematics all affect the final measured cross section. The total uncertainty will then ideally be the combination of independent matrices corresponding to each systematic source, as shown below:
% cuts-based variation
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sys_error}
M^{syst} =  M^{genie} + M^{flux} + M^{detector}
\end{equation}

\noindent In this section, we explore the degree to which each of these sources contributes to the final uncertainty. 
\subsection{Uncertainty Propagation} 
There is a simple prescription to follow when approaching systematic uncertainty evaluation. We must first identify contributing parameters and their corresponding degrees of uncertainty.  Then, we vary these parameters randomly across many iterations, each time recalculating the cross section.
\par There are two approaches to take in assesing the 1$\sigma$ uncertainties on our variations. If a variation in parameter assignment affects only the rates of event production, a reweighing scheme can be applied to the final distributions rather than re-doing the full simulation for each generated universe.  This re-weighting strategy can be applied to uncertainty sources such as beam flux and GENIE cross sections.  For example, if the CC-neutrino interaction rate is halved by a parameter adjustment to the underlying neutrino interaction models, we can simply apply a factor of one-half to our final calculations.  On the other hand, if parameter adjustments affect event topology, re-weighting will not be sufficient, and a full generation of detector MC must be performed. One example of such a parameter is space charge. Space charge refers to the presence of positively charged ions that are formed when the argon is ionized.  These ions influence the recombination of ionization electrons from new interactions, and can cause distortions in the readout. To handle space charge and other detector effects, we must generate samples for each effect and study the impact on our selection. A framework exists to do these variations, and studies here are on going. For now, we limit our systematic evaluations of the flux and GENIE cross sections.

\subsection{GENIE Cross Sections}
The impact of each GENIE parameter variation can be tested by reweighing event distributions using the built-in GENIE event reweighting framework. Here, each physical parameter P is varied by $\pm$1$\sigma$. The output of this variation is a set of event weights per parameter that represent the output had you run with the varied parameter from the beginning. A summary of parameters utilized for this study is summarized in Table \ref{tab:genie_parameters}. We note the absence of MEC parameter variation in the reweighting framework used here, however, this uncertainty will contribute negligibly due to the small portion of MEC events at the final stage of both selection paths.

\par Once we have obtained our event re-weighting results, we calculate the cross section variation by considering the variation to the background B and to the efficiency $\epsilon$, as shown in Equation \ref{eq:genie_xsec_var}. We do not consider variation to total tagged events N, as this quantity will be measured directly from data.  To calculate the cross section percentile difference due to a single parameter variation, we then compare $\sigma^\pm$ to nominal $\sigma$ calculated in earlier for each selection as shown in Equation \ref{eq:genie_xsec_percentdiff}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:genie_xsec_var}
  \sigma^\pm \propto \frac{N - B^\pm}{\epsilon^\pm} 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:genie_xsec_percentdiff}
  Percentile\ Difference = \frac{| \sigma - \sigma^\pm |}{\sigma} 
\end{equation}

\par Event re-weighting as described was run over the full 4.232e20 POT simulation events used throughout the note. The results of this reweighting scheme are shown in Table \ref{tab:genie_results} for the higher variation (i.e., +$\sigma$ or -$\sigma$). In summary, the CC 1-$\pi^0$ analysis chain is most affected by the axial mass for CC resonance production;  this result is supported by Figure \ref{fig:physics_2shower_inttype}, in which resonant processes dominate the neutrino interaction modes of selected events. The final sample is also sensitive to the form zone parameter, nucleon elastic reaction probability, and the nucleon mean free path.   Finally, we see a significant contribution from the $\pi$ absorption probability. We also expect this; variation in the probability for $\pi$ absorption in the nucleus is correlated with the resulting number of $\pi^0$'s originating from the nucleus and entering our signal sample.  
%\par Finally, we consider the contribution of each parameter weighting to individual signal and backgrounds.  We do this by applying reweighting ONLY to the signal or to the individual  background we're focusing on, and then comparing to the nominal as in Equation \ref{eq:genie_xsec_percentdiff}. These results are shown in Table \ref{tab:genie_bkgd_2shower_var_results} for the 2-shower sample and in Table \ref{tab:genie_bkgd_2shower_var_results} for the 1-shower sample. To interpret the information in this table, we consider the example of $M_A^{CCRES}$ in Table \ref{tab:genie_bkgd_2shower_var_results}. We expect variation of this parameter to dominantly affect CC Resonant processes.  What we see is that variations to this individual parameter have no impact on the NC backgrounds (0.00\%) and a maximum impact on FSEM, which contains all $\nu_\mu$ CC events with electromagnetic activity in the final state. 
%Note that while the breakdowns Tables \ref{tab:genie_bkgd_2shower_var_results} and \ref{tab:genie_bkgd_2shower_var_results} gives us an idea of the contribution of each background to the overall uncertainty, we can not quadratically sum these breakdowns to estimate the final uncertainty.

We conclude here by combining the uncertainties in quadrature and calculating a 12.08\% uncertainty for the 2-shower path and a 13.80\% uncertainty for the 1-shower path from the GENIE model.  The higher uncertainty on the 1-shower sample is due to the lower purity of the single shower selection path.

\subsection{Flux Systematics}
When considering uncertainty due to flux, we are primarily interested in variations of particle production at the target ($\pi^+$, $\pi^-$, $K^+$, $K^-$, $K^0$) and POT.  The uncertainty due to POT counting (roughly 2\%, measured in the beam hall) is considerably smaller than that due to the flux itself. 
\par To evaluate the flux systematic contribution, we consider variations on a series of parameters.  These parameter variations cover uncertainty on the depth by which the current penetrates into the horn conductor (the ‘skin effect’), the current that the horn is pulsed with, pion and nucleon cross sections
(total, inelastic, and quasi-elastic) on aluminum and beryllium and hadron production. To report our results, we combine all non-hadron production uncertainty contributions into one reported value called `FluxUnisim', while keeping the hadronic parameters separated. With these parameter variations in mind, the EventWeight calculator produces 1000 multisims using a unique random number generator seed for each flux systematic uncertainty. Per event, we then proceed to calculate 1000 cross sections using the information stored in these 1000 universes.  We do this using the Equation \ref{eq:flux_xsec_var_0} for i in 0 - 1000 universes:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:flux_xsec_var_0}
  \sigma_i \propto \frac{N - B_i}{\epsilon_i \phi_i} 
\end{equation}

Where `N' is the On - OffBeam value from the final stage of each selection path, $B_i$ is the weighted background contribution in the i'th universe, $\epsilon_i$ is the i'th universe efficiency, and $\phi_i$ is the flux renormalization factor for the i'th universe.  We use the modified fluxes to integrate from 0 to 3 GeV and determine the flux through the detector in the i'th universe. This integration across the full energy range increases our overall systematic uncertainty due to the behavior of spline fits to the HARP $\pi^{+}$ production data in regions where there is no HARP data~\cite{bib:flux_uncertainty_tn}. 

%This uncertainty could be reduced by utilizing a physical constraint on the pion production in these regions.   

Once 1000 cross sections are calculated, we calculate 1000 corresponding percentile differences with respect to the nominal according to Equation \ref{eq:genie_xsec_percentdiff}. We then use the percentile variations to extract a 1 $\sigma$ uncertainty from the nominal value at 0 for each varied flux parameter.

\subsection{Detector Simulation Systematics}

There are three types of systematics we need to account for when considering the uncertainty on our detector simulation.  There are the uncertainties due to the CORSIKA cosmic models employed in the simulation, the number of targets in the analysis fiducial volume, and finally the overall simulation of various detector effects. 

\subsubsection{MC-based Cosmic Simulation}\label{sec:cosuncert}
 The cosmic ray muon flux has previously been measured to be $141\pm21~\text{Hz~m}^2$ in the MicroBooNE detector hall~\cite{datacosflux}.  This value compares to the CORSIKA-generated flux of $160.9\pm0.3~\text{Hz~m}^2$~\cite{mccosflux} in a comparable location.  Due to the proximity of these values, and the fact that the cosmic showers we select typically originate from cosmic muons (delta-rays, bremsstrahlung, Michel electrons), we know that our simulation of the overall cosmic muon flux is not more than 100\% off.
\par The ``Cosmic + Neutrino'' background makes up 6\% of both the two- and one-shower selected events. To conservatively assess a preliminary uncertainty on the simulation, we calculate an overall 100\% uncertainty for both selections. Given this variation we find a resulting systematic on the final cross section of 10\% and 11\% for the two- and one-shower selection, respectively. 
\par Future assessments of CORSIKA uncertainty contribution will be avoided by using OffBeam EXT data overlaid with GENIE simulations. These efforts are currently under way.
 
\subsubsection{Number of Targets}\label{sec:ntarguncert}

The two contributors to potential variation on our calculated number of targets are argon density and fiducial volume. To understand the uncertainty on the density, we must also understand the temperature and pressure of the detector during the time our data was taken. These values are extracted from sensors in the detector and cryogenics system. During our period of data taking, temperature and pressure are measured to be $89.2 \pm 0.3$~K and $1.241 \pm 0.004$~bar respectively. Using these variations, the uncertainty on the liquid argon density is $1.3836^{+0.0019}_{-0.0002}~\frac{\text{g}}{\text{cm}^3}$, a 0.1\% effect. This effect is safely negligible considering the size of the other uncertainties we are taking into account.
\par Second, we must understand how our fiducial volume is affected by space charge. Electric field distortions in the detector (due mainly to passing cosmic ray muons) cause regions of the detector to appear to be within our fiducial volume and vice-versa. To assess an uncertainty on this we take the TPC volume and divide it into $0.0619~\text{cm}^3$ voxels. We then utilize simulated space charge displacement maps to compute the voxels that moved in and out of our defined fiducial volume. This leads to a change in the fiducial volume of 6.3\%. Treating this as the 1$\sigma$ variation we find a fractional change in the cross section measurement of 6.3\% for both selections. 


%There are three classes of detector simulation based systematic uncertainties that we are taking into account in this section of the note. Those due to the overall simulation of detector effects (known colloquially as ``detector systematics''), those due to the modeling of the CORSIKA cosmic simulation, and finally those associated with the number of targets that are contained in the fiducial volume.    

\subsubsection{Detector Simulation Unisims}
Detector simulation variations contribute the type of uncertainties we can't model easily by applying a reweight scheme. To assess these uncertainties, we must generate complementary, full detector simulations per systematic effect, and pass them all through our selection chain. By using the same set of base events we will minimize the statistical variation in the sample and hone in directly on the systematic due to the model change.  This is particularly important because our efficiency is relatively low, and will require a large number of statistics to be able to resolve systematic from statistical effects.  Using these varied simulations, we will assess the uncertainty by remeasuring the cross section given a central value (CV) sample.  We will then remeasure the cross section for each variation under the assumption that each unisim represents a 1$\sigma$ shift. Since this is not in principle true, we will create conservative variations in the underlaying parameters that will produce a conservative estimate of these uncertainties. This work is on-going, and will conclude in the near future. 

%Currently we are producing the following unisims through production and will process them in the near future:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Shut off space-charge
%\item Turn on a simulation of the dynamic induced charge effect 
%\item Fix a bug in the scintillation light generated by different particles
%\item Stretch the reconstruction response function by 20\% in time 
%\item Mask out misconfigured channels
%\item Mask out channels that are prone to having their ASICs saturate
%\item Turn off the PMT single PE noise
%\item Turn off the data-drive signal response (effectively a perfect calibration)
%\item Switch to using a white-noise model for the electronics noise simulation
%\item Increase the visibility of the region outside the active TPC volume by 50\%
%\item Set the electron lifetime to 10ms 
%\item Turn off lateral diffusion 
%\item Turn off transverse diffusion 
%\item Switch to using a simulation of the recombination based on the Birk’s model 
%\end{itemize}
%
%\noindent Additionally, we are studying the effect of adjusting the following GEANT parameters:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Turn off delta ray production 
%\item Turn off hadronic interactions in the bulk
%\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Total Detector Simulation Uncertainty}
	
We assess the overall detector systematic effect by taking the quadratic sum of each of these effects. Currently we are only integrating the values from Sec.~\ref{sec:cosuncert} and~\ref{sec:ntarguncert}.  This assessment leads to an overall uncertainty on the final cross section of 12\% and 13\% for the two- and one-shower selection respectively.

 \section{Conclusion}
In this note, we described a procedure that culminated in a total integrated charged current single $\pi^0$ cross section on argon. We began by defining our signal as neutrino-induced charged current interactions with a single $\pi^0$ in the final state originating from a FV-contained vertex.  We then implemented a series of cuts which mitigated the high cosmic background, and identified events with a $\nu$-induced $\mu$ candidate.  We next identified electromagnetic activity in each plane and used this information to reconstruct 3D shower candidates. Finally, we considered a variety of spatial correlations and shower parameters to create two distinct final samples: a two shower and a one shower selected sample.  With these final selected events, we were able to calculate the uncertainties due to the neutrino flux production, GENIE interaction modeling, and the detector simulation contributions to the final result.  These results are summarized below, and plotted with the flux and GENIE prediction in Figure \ref{fig:genie_uboone_xsec2} :\\

\noindent $\langle \sigma\rangle_{\phi,\geq 2 \text{showers}}=$ (2.56 $\pm$ $0.50_{stat}$ $\pm$ $0.31_{genie}$ $\pm$ $0.37_{flux}$ $\pm$ $0.31_{det}$) $\times$ $10^{-38}$ $\frac{cm^2}{Ar}$ \\

\noindent $\langle \sigma\rangle_{\phi,\geq 1 \text{shower}}=$ (2.64 $\pm$ $0.33_{stat}$ $\pm$ $0.36_{genie}$ $\pm$ $0.38_{flux}$ $\pm$ $0.35_{det}$) $\times$ $10^{-38}$ $\frac{cm^2}{Ar}$ \\

\noindent This is the first charged current single $\pi^0$ cross section measured on argon.
