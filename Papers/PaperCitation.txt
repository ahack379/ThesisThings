Found that the solar neutrino flux due to B8 reaction was < 3*10^-36 captures per sec , or 3 SNU.

Ran 1970-1994
108 Solar neutrino observations
Sensitivity increased using pulse rise time restriction (discrim between signal and background)
2500m below surface in Homestake (exp located at teh 4850ft level)
Experiment leak tested because atmosphere is 0.934% Argon (he vacuum leak tested)
C2Cl4.  Ar37 created by reaction decays back to Cl37-- reach saturation level where decay = production
Divide by saturation fraction and multiple by decay constant-- should get rate of the reaction sum(flux*cross section)
Backgrounds: cosmics muon->proton (proton causes bkgd), rock neutrons from alpha emitters (thorium and uranium), internal alphas, negligible contribution from atmospheric neutrinos 
Thorough review of the work in **4 confirmed that ~1/3 of the expected events were observed at Homestake
Later when Kamiokande data became available, it was seen that probably closer to ~0.5 of the expected events were observed. Be7 <1/10 expected value-- pp consistent
~10^6 B8 neutrinos cm^-2 s^-1 elec neutrino flux from sun
SNO and Kamiokande sensitive to B8 neutrino flux
Galium and SAGE sensitive to Be7 , pep, CNO elec neutrino fluxes

Threshold 5MeV (vs 0.814MeV from previous-- sensitive to higher energy neutrinos (from atmosphere?))
Used the angle of the interaction with respect to the direction of the sun (very directional events)
22.5kton water cherenkov detector which detects solar neutrinos elastic scatter off atomic electrons

**7] Real-time, directional measurement of 8 solar neutrinos in the Kamiokande II detector
SSM: Solar core in hydrogen burning phase, in which 4 H nuclei convert into He nucleus, 2 positrongs and 2 neutrinos with release of 26.7 MeV 
98.5% of sun's energy generated from reaction pp->dev, 1.5% CNO cycle
Total neutrino flux on earth : 6.6*10^10 /cm^2/s
B8 reaction is of interest mainly because of its higher energies (up to 15 MeV), but accounts for less than 10^-4 of total flux
B8 flux largely uncertain because the reaction it results from Be7+p->B8Y is dependent on temperature of center of sun
and value of proton Be7 cross section at low protn KE
SIZE: Cylinder 16m high, 15.6 m diameter.  
10 MeV electron leaves point-like track of 5cm
