Found that the solar neutrino flux due to B8 reaction was < 3*10^-36 captures per sec , or 3 SNU.

108 Solar neutrino observations
Sensitivity increased using pulse rise time restriction (discrim between signal and background)
2500m below surface in Homestake (exp located at teh 4850ft level)
Experiment leak tested because atmosphere is 0.934% Argon (he vacuum leak tested)
C2Cl4.  Ar37 created by reaction decays back to Cl37-- reach saturation level where decay = production
Divide by saturation fraction and multiple by decay constant-- should get rate of the reaction sum(flux*cross section)
Backgrounds: cosmics muon->proton (proton causes bkgd), rock neutrons from alpha emitters (thorium and uranium), internal alphas, negligible contribution from atmospheric neutrinos 
Thorough review of the work in **4 confirmed that ~1/3 of the expected events were observed at Homestake
Later when Kamiokande data became available, it was seen that probably closer to ~0.5 of the expected events were observed. Be7 <1/10 expected value-- pp consistent

Used the angle of the interaction with respect to the direction of the sun (very directional events)
22.5kton water cherenkov detector which detects solar neutrinos elastic scatter off atomic electrons

SSM: Solar core in hydrogen burning phase, in which 4 H nuclei convert into He nucleus, 2 positrongs and 2 neutrinos with release of 26.7 MeV 
98.5% of sun's energy generated from reaction pp->dev, 1.5% CNO cycle
Total neutrino flux on earth : 6.6*10^10 /cm^2/s
B8 reaction is of interest mainly because of its higher energies (up to 15 MeV), but accounts for less than 10^-4 of total flux
B8 flux largely uncertain because the reaction it results from Be7+p->B8Y is dependent on temperature of center of sun
and value of proton Be7 cross section at low protn KE

10 MeV electron leaves point-like track of 5cm

Only electron neutrinos can interact in a charged current interaction in which the neutron in the deuteron->proton. This is because the solar neutrinos have energies less than then mass of muon (105.7 MeV) and tau (1776.82 MeV).  Electron carries off most of the neutrino's energy (5-15 MeV).  Proton produces less energy and is more difficult to detect.
In a neutral current interaction a neutrino dissociates the neutron proton and the neutrino and continues on with less energy.  Neutron capture cross section is small on heavy water(deuterium)-- when it IS captured, emits a 6 MeV gamma ray. All three neutrinos interact with equal probability.
