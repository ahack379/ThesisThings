1]Threshold of neutrino capture reaction v+Cl37->Ar37 + e- is 0.816 MeV. Thus, from flux plot and the 
fact that the cross section for the capture reaction is very large for the energetic neutrinos from B8 reaction, B8 neutrinos make up 90% of the nuetrinos.  The others come from Be7 decay at 0.861 MeV.  

2]Upper limit of neutron capture rate per Cl37 atom was 2x less than expected from solar model calculations

Increase sensitivity, gain insight into other neutruno fluxes such as those from Be7, and HHe-vD. 80% due to B8

3]Experiment in Homestake ran from 1970-1985 2.1+/-0.3 SNU (with increased sensitivity using pulse rise-time measuremnets. 

4] 1998 RD - neutrino capture cross section increases greatly above 5.8 MeV due to gs transition of Cl37 to isobaric state Ar37
